        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hearthstone is a Competitive Card game based around the Warcraft theme, created by Blizzard
        Entertainment.</p>

        <p>In Hearthstone players compete in one versus one card battles between either two players or a player and an
        A.I opponent.</p>

        <p>Players are required to choose one of two Heroes and create card decks of thirty cards in order to compete
        in a Hearthstone Battle.</p>

        <p>Players take turns in playing cards from their hands which include Spells, Weapons and Minions in attempt to
        destroy the enemy opponent.</p>

        <p>Each Hero in Hearthstone has thirty Health Points, in order to win the game a player is required to reduce
        the opposing Heroes Health Points from thirty to zero.</p>

        <p>The game starts with a random player that gets chosen to go first. Players then draw their starting cards
        from their own constructed thirty card decks. The player who goes first draws three cards and the player who
        goes second draws four cards and is given a special card called The Coin.</p>

        <p>The players a both then given one chance to swap out any of their starting cards for another card from the
        top of their deck, the cards they swap out are then shuffled back into the deck.</p>

        <p>After both players are finished with their starting card draws, the game begins.</p>

        <p>Each turn players are granted one additional mana crystal. On the first turn, each player has one mana
        crystal, up to turn ten where a player will have the maximum amount of Mana, 10. Mana Crystals are
        replenished with Mana each turn.</p>

        <p>During a turn, a player can choose to play any of the cards in their hand as long as they have enough Mana
        Crystals for the required card they desire to use. From a players hand they can either put a Minion on the
        board, cast a Spell or equip a Weapon.</p>

        <p>Minions are played into the center board area between both player Heroes. Minions can be used to attack
        Heroes or other minions and come in a wide variety all with their own unique statistics and effects.</p>

        <p>Spells are played directly from a players hand and have an immediate effect unique to each Spell Card.</p>

        <p>Weapons, like spells, are also played directly from a players hand, however they add a Weapon to a players
        arsenal allowing him to attack directly with his Hero, rather than their minions and spells.</p>

        <p>A player can only have ten cards in their hand at a time, any cards drawn over this limit, are
        destroyed.</p>

        <p>Players can also use Hero Powers, which cost two mana and each is specific and relevant to his chosen Hero.
        For example, a Priests Hero Power is Heal and a Mages Hero Power is Fire Blast.</p>

        <p>As the match goes on, playing turn by turn, eventually one player will have been reduced to zero health
        points. This player has lost the game.</p>

        <p>If a match goes on for too long without a player being destroyed, after a player has drawn all thirty cards
        from his deck they will start to take damage which increases by one point each turn, eventually destroying
        them.</p>

        <p>A player can choose to concede at any point during a game, if a player concedes, they will lose the
        game.</p>
